enjoy the expanded sd slot.
turns i do because of the ease of usage.
easy to learn and enjoyable!
i am very annoyed.
it shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason.
he loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.
easy navigation.
the case protects it well.
the first one had issues and best buy exchanged it.
the parental control could be a lot better.
i bought a warranty for it.
just wish it had bluetooth.
my fault for not reading up on his device before hand.
perfect gift for kids.
excellent sound and fun.
the picture is great too.
great size, easy to carry for traveling.
my 8 year old loves the tablet.
i bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader.
i liked the idea of having both my kindle and tablet in one.
they are a good learning tool.
my 2 year old granddaughter loves her amazon kids edition.
i'm not using them.i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands.
just as functional as my ipad
battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights.
this is the best thing for reading specially on the go.
my son and i use the tablet everyday 2 times morning and night and theres so much to do on it.
big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.
my kids watch videos and play games on these a lot.
i highly recommend the tap!
love it.
i honestly didn't think i would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot.
this thing is just as good as an xbox1 or ps4.
i enjoy all the features on the fire 7 tablet!!!!!
main drawback: the constant advertising!
it has proved its worth already.
it is the perfect size for sitting in a coffee shop or on your couch to read a book or watch your favorite tv show.
the produces good sound at all levels, plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the echo can do, just with mobility added to it (as opposed to the echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work).
the kindle fire is great because it‚äôs so durable
best thing i like is that its portable and the battery life is very reasonable.
tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet
good stepping stone for future producs
charges up quickly.

my kids like it very much!
this tablet is such a great buy.
i love this tablet.i bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it.
kids love it!
battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners.
just okay!
looks like he's going to love it!
it does no good to use this cable if both devices are not usb 3.0.
must have for my 2 kids.
we can read together in bed, in the woods, on the road or wherever we like.
it's big then the one i had i would tell my friends
durable structure that can withstand drops.
he also loves all the books, and aps.
display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point.

this is my 3rd kindle upgrade.
it's very easy to use...
i love this solutions for my kids.

it a great tablet for children.
pretty cool kids love it.
i love the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing.
the case is well constructed and has many compartments.
and of course faster processor, etc.
this is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!
thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
we got this for my son for xmas.
purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since i notice that she loves phone screens and tablets.
she enjoy every minute of it.the parental control it's a plus.
no issues whatsoever.
speed of tablet was good.
tablet is fast and works as it should.
no complaints here!
so this product has limits.
